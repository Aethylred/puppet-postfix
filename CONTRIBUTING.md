# Contributing

Welcome to my stuff, really, take it, it's GPL. Just remember to attribute it back to me. If your changes are visible to on GitHub, I'll pull features back from your forks when they look good, but preferably you'll submit Pull Requests.

This module is intended to be reasonably strict with the following criteria:

* the configuration files are all to be modified through augeas
* all features are to be tested with rspec tests
* all features must be idempotent

Note that I work on this module on an irregular basis and I may not respond rapidly to requests.
